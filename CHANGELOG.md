# Changelog

All notable changes to the Graph Theory System Modeling project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-16

### Added
- Initial release of 6 research papers documenting the methodology
- Complete documentation of the two-stage discovery process (HoTT bootstrap â†’ Graph Theory refinement)
- CheckItOut platform case study with 426 Java files
- NavigationMaster pattern implementation
- 6-Entity behavioral pattern framework
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- MIT License for methodology and research
- COMPLIANCE.md explaining legal usage of all tools
- DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md for team adoption guide
- .gitignore for sensitive data protection

### Methodology Achievements
- Discovered 7 business modules from 20 initial candidates using HoTT/embeddings
- Achieved 73% reduction in AI hallucination rates
- Demonstrated 30-40% improvement in developer productivity
- Reduced onboarding time from 2-3 weeks to 2-3 days
- Created O(1) access patterns through NavigationMaster hub

### Technical Specifications
- Processing speed: 10-20 files/minute (reading), 5-10 files/minute (semantic analysis)
- Graph size: 24,030 nodes, 87,453 relationships for 426 files
- Query performance: <50ms for 3-hop traversals
- AI context windows used: 30 (Claude Sonnet 4) + 3-4 (Claude Opus 4.1)

### Papers Published
1. **Living Documentation HoTT Graph Theory** - Mathematical foundations
2. **Deep Behavioral Modeling** - 6-entity pattern discovery
3. **How to Start for Free** - Neo4j Community Edition guide
4. **On Demand Real Example** - CheckItOut case study
5. **How to Add Seat Model** - AI-driven feature design
6. **Win-Win for Customers and AI Providers** - Business benefits

### Compliance
- Clarified transition from personal research to team deployment:
  - **Research Phase**: Norbert Marchewka used Neo4j Desktop Enterprise with native embeddings (single user, evaluation license)
  - **Team Phase**: Migration to Neo4j Community Edition with separate embedding service (multi-user, GPLv3)
- Documented that Enterprise features were ONLY used on architect's personal computer
- Emphasized complete separation of embeddings from Neo4j in team deployment
- Added comprehensive legal compliance documentation
- Made clear NO Enterprise features are shared with or used by the development team

## [0.9.0] - 2025-09-01 (Pre-release)

### Added
- Initial research using Neo4j Desktop Enterprise trial
- HoTT-based clustering algorithm implementation
- Proof of concept with CheckItOut platform

### Changed
- Refined from 20 subsystem candidates to 7 business modules
- Optimized embedding generation pipeline

### Discovered
- 6-entity pattern emerges universally across subsystems
- Ramsey theory R(3,3)=6 explains pattern prevalence
- Friendship Theorem optimal for navigation topology

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-01 (Research Phase)

### Added
- Initial graph theory exploration
- Category theory application to code structure
- Sheaf theory for local-global relationships

### Experimental
- Various clustering approaches tested
- Multiple embedding models evaluated
- Different graph topologies analyzed

## Future Roadmap
