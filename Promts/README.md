## üéØ MCP Server Requirements Summary

### Minimal Setup (For Debuggers)
- `mcp-memory`: Persistent state storage
- `mcp-sequential-thinking`: Multi-step reasoning

### Full Setup (For Graph Theory Implementations)
- `neo4j-memory`: Graph-based persistence
- `neo4j-cypher`: Graph database operations

## üí° Key Notes

- **Educational Guides** require no setup - start here to learn
- **Debuggers** (ErdosDebugger, ClineDebugger) need only 2 MCP servers for powerful analysis
- **Graph Theory Implementations** are based on academic research papers and require more extensive Neo4j setup
- All prompts follow the NavigationMaster pattern for consistent cognitive architecture
