# Author's Declaration on Tool Usage

**Author**: Norbert Marchewka  
**Role**: Software Architect, CheckItOut Platform  
**Date**: September 16, 2025

## Declaration

I hereby declare the following regarding the use of Neo4j and related tools in this research:

### Personal Research Phase (Completed)

As the sole architect conducting initial research, I used:
- **Neo4j Desktop Enterprise Edition** on my personal development computer
- **Native vector embeddings** (Enterprise feature) for rapid prototyping
- **Evaluation license** terms (30-day trial, explicitly allowed by Neo4j)

This usage was:
- ✅ Limited to my personal computer only
- ✅ Never shared with other developers
- ✅ Never deployed to any server
- ✅ Used solely for research and pattern discovery
- ✅ Fully compliant with Neo4j evaluation terms

### Team Deployment Phase (Current/Planned)

For team-wide adoption, we are migrating to:
- **Neo4j Community Edition** (GPLv3 license)
- **External embedding service** (completely separate from Neo4j)
- **Shared infrastructure** accessible to all developers
- **No Enterprise features** whatsoever

## Key Points

1. **No Enterprise Features in Production**: The team deployment will NOT use any Enterprise features
2. **Complete Separation**: Vector embeddings will be computed outside Neo4j
3. **Legal Compliance**: All usage complies with respective licenses
4. **Transparency**: This transition is fully documented for clarity

## Technical Migration

The migration involves:
1. Extracting embeddings from my Enterprise Desktop instance
2. Setting up separate embedding service (using open-source models)
3. Deploying Neo4j Community Edition for the team
4. Re-importing data with externally computed embeddings

## Legal Statement

I confirm that:
- The Enterprise Edition was used only for personal research under evaluation terms
- No Enterprise features or code are being distributed or shared
- The team deployment uses only Community Edition features
- All vector embeddings for team use are computed separately

This approach ensures complete legal compliance while transitioning from individual research to team-wide adoption.
